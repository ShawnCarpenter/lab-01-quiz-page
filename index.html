                <p>
                In 2013 a group allegedly asked the Icelandic supreme court to stop road work because the construction would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/22/elf-lobby-iceland-road-project">bother the elves</a> living in the area. Really? I don't think so.

                <h3>They eat rotten shark</h3>
                <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A1karl">HÃ¡karl</a> is supposedly shark meat that has been buried in the sand for 6-12 weeks then hung out to dry for four or five months.
                </p>
                It has been described in the following ways:
                <ol>
                    <li> "the single worst, most disgusting and terrible tasting thing" </li>
                    <li>"That's hardcore. That's serious food. You don't want to mess with that. That's not for beginners."</li>
                    <li>"smells of urine, a really strong aftertaste, it really kicks in. It really kicks in at the back of the throat after you take the first bite."</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                After bankers destroyed the world economy in 2008 the rest of the world threw money at them but we are expected to believe that iceland <a href="https://grapevine.is/news/2018/02/07/36-bankers-96-years-in-jail/">prosecuted</a>  them? And put them in jail? No way.
